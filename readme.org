* Telnet-like server with webpage support
  This is a simple implementation of a tcp server that parses received packets and displays in a webpage. When received information is not HTTP 1.1 compatible it sends it back.

** Compiling and running
  In order to compile the client and server the follow commands must be run:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  make build/server
  make build/client
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Their respective executables will be on the =build/= folder.

  The server has the following options:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ( -h  | --help )              : Displays help message
  ( -v  | --verbose )           : Displays more processing information
  ( -n  | --hostname) <STRING>  : Hostname of the server to connect
  ( -p  | --port) <N>           : Port to which connect in the informed hostname
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  The client has the following options:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ( -h  | --help )              : Displays help message
  ( -v  | --verbose )           : Displays more processing information
  ( -p  | --port) <N>           : Port to which bind the socket
  ( -m  | --message ) <STRING>  : Welcome message to greet new connection
  #+END_EXAMPLE
